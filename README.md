Project Description:
Fragmented Realities-
Digital media ecosystems often create their own parallel worlds where each of us sees a personalized mix of information, beliefs, and culture. Because algorithms filter and tailor what appears on our screens, we can end up living inside separate realities that feel complete and convincing, even when they differ wildly from someone else’s.
My interactive project plays with this idea. The phone becomes a small portal into a curated collection of moments and places, showing how our digital footprints shape the stories we tell about our lives. 
As viewers flick through the travel photos, they step into one of these parallel worlds but an edited, aesthetic version of my experiences defined not just by where I’ve been, but by what I chose to notice and capture.
This project indludes pictures, all of which i took my self at different places i have travelled to.
