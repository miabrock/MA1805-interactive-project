Project Description:
Fragmented Realities-
Digital media ecosystems often create their own parallel worlds where each of us sees a personalized mix of information, beliefs, and culture. Because algorithms filter and tailor what appears on our screens, we can end up living inside separate realities that feel complete and convincing, even when they differ a lot from someone else’s.
My interactive project plays with this idea. The phone becomes a small portal into a curated collection of moments and places, showing how our digital footprints shape the stories we tell about our lives. 
As viewers flick through the travel photos, they step into one of these parallel worlds but an edited, aesthetic version of my experiences defined not just by where I’ve been, but by what I chose to notice and capture.
This project indludes pictures, all of which i took my self at different places i have travelled to.

Inspiration:
I got inspiration from these case studies because I found them interesting and inspirin:
-Olia Lialina (1996), My Boyfriend Came Back from the War ​
-Joan Heemskerk & Dirk Paesmans, Jodi.org
I also got inspiration from the concept of social media.

Challenges I encountered:
The issues that i have experienced are, organisation, i have found that it has been quite difficult to ​organinse my files and make sure that everything was put together correctly so that my website can run in the way that i intended.
Another one is time​, i think that learning how to manage my time when creating this projeect alongside other assignments and working has been quite difficult and a challenge that i needed to overcome. 
Lastly is the layout, i struggled at the beginning to make my website layout look the way i wanted it to. It took quite a few different attempts but in the end i figured out how to do it. 
Overall though I think that in the time given I have managed to create a good example of an interactive project which is what i was aiming to achieve.
